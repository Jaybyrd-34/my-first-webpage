    <h1>Some favorite places</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
      There are so many beautiful places in the world, heck even in your own
      backyard there are at least 12<span>(lol)</span>. I have traveled some in my 34 years, mostly in my
      own country and I have checked of 25 states and 3 countries to be exact. I can tell you that all of these 
      places had beauty, some profound and some it took effort to find, but they were all beautiful 
      in their own way. Of all the places, I would have to say that my home of 6 years tops the list. Oregon is 
      special. It has a little bit of everything. You want pristine ocean beach, You got it! How about mountain 
      lakes hidden deep in a lush green forest, You got it! Wanna get lost in the desert and trip balls on mushrooms, 
      No problem!
